 * A WindowChangeEvent adds to the information that can be associated with windows
 * and adds to the functionality of <code>WindowEvent</code>.
 * <p>The class adds to <code>WindowEvent</code> by providing events that describe
 * all the ways a window can change its position and/or its location.  
 * <p><b>Note:</b>  These events merely tell the listener what the window <i>should</i>
 * do.  It is the listener's responsibility to take the appropriate action on the window
 * itself.
